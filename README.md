## Data preprocessing

- Remove geo, media, and author columns because they contain no data. 
- Remove unrelated tweets: CSGO, Covid, “spreading/spread like wildfire”
- Remove non-English tweets
- Remove retweets and log frequency of retweets
-	Removing special characters
-	Extract features: caps, exclamations, hashtag, key words (Adrian), links (“news” in expanded urls), frequency of retweets
-	Compare parse trees of tweets

## Model building 
-	Training the model
-	Validation
-	Present results: graph of the clusters
